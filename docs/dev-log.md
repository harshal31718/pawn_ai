**Commit:** [hash]

### 2026-06-15 — Step 1: Create the Repo

**Built:** Directory skeleton — `backend/app/` (main.py, config.py, constants.py, routes/, core/), `backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/`. Stub files only; real content in Steps 2.5 and 4.
**Decisions:** Stub files use one-line comments pointing to the step that fills them in; avoids empty files while keeping the tree readable.
**Issues:** None.
**Tests:** N/A (directory structure only).
**Commit:** chore: init repo — directory structure

### 2026-06-15 — Step 2: Claude Code Config (done in scaffolding session)

**Built:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `settings.json`, 4 rule files, 5 agent files, `skills/build-step/SKILL.md`. PreToolUse + PostToolUse hooks block secrets writes and force-push.
**Decisions:** Used plan/12-claude-setup-guide.md verbatim as the authoritative source for all .claude/ content.
**Issues:** None.
**Tests:** N/A.
**Commit:** chore: project scaffolding — .claude config, docs/, secrets pattern
